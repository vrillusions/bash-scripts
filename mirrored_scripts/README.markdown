# Mirrored scripts

The files in this area are not my own but I find them useful. Thus the licensing I applied to project is not valid for anything in `mirrored_scripts/*`. All licenses and copyrights are included where possible (some don't mention a license).

If you are the owner of a script in here and don't want it listed here let me know or open a ticket and I'll remove it.
